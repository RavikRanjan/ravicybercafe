            <h1>History of Bank</h1>
            <p>The History of Banking begins with the first prototype banks of merchants of the ancient
                world that made grain loans to farmers and traders carrying goods between cities; recorded as
                having occured at about 2000 BC within the areas of Assyria and J3abylonia.<br/> Later on, in
                ancient Greece and during the Roman Empire, lenders based in temples made loans and
                added two important innovations: the accepting of deposits and the changing of money.
                Archaeology from this period in ancient China and India, shows the existence also of money
                lending activity.<br/><br/>
                Banking, in the modern sense of the word, can be traced to medieval and early Renaissance
                Italy,to the rich cities in the north such as F1orence, Veniceand Genoa. The Bardi and Peruzzi
                families dominated banking in 14th century Florence, establishing branches in many other
                parts of Europe.<br/><br/>
                The development of banking spread through Europe also and a number of important
                innovations look place in Amsterdam during the Dutch Republic in the 16th century and in
                London in the 17th century.<br/> During the 20th century, developments in telecommunications
                and computing resulting in major changes to the way banks operated and allowed them to
                dramatically increase in size and geographic spread. The Late-2000 financial crisis saw
                significant number of bank failures, including some of the world's largest banks, and much
                debate about bank regulation.<br/><br/>

            <h1>The Evolution of Banking Services and its History in India</h1>
            <p>Banking in India has a very hoary origin. The Vedic period has literature which records the
                giving ofloans to others. Banking was synonymous with money lending. The Manusmrithi
                speaks of deposits, pledges, loans and interest rate.<br/> Interest could be legally charged at
                between two and five per cent per month in order of class. The maximum amount of interest
                collectable on the principal was laid down by the State. <br/>Usury was not allowed. Payment of
                debt was made a pious obligation on the heir of a dead person. With the growth of trade and
                commerce, the trading community soon evolved a system of money transfer throughout the
                country.<br/><br/>
                Modem banking in India began with the rise to power of the British. The British consolidated
                their power and became the most powerful force in India after vanquishing Tipu Sultan in the
                battle of Srirangapattanam in 1799. The quest for power by Lord Mornington (Later
                Marquess of Welle sly).<br/> Governor General of Fort William in Bengal at that time led to a
                serious depletion of the resources of the East India Company, This led to the Company
                promoting the Bank of Calcutta in 1806 to raise resources. <br/><br/>The situation prevailing at that
                time could be known by the writing of some Britishers, C.N. Cooke, Deputy Secretary and
                Treasurer of the Bank of Bengal, writing in his book "Banking in India", has stated that usury
                prevailed in India more than in any other country in the nineteenth century.<br/> The native money
                lender lent to the farmers at 40, 50 and 60 per cent interest. The European community was
                relatively better off. He attributed the very high rates to the riskiness of many of the lending
                and the difficulties in realising them. <br/><br/>Indian businessmen very often acted as lender to the
                European businessmen with a rate of interest lower than the market rate. European businessmen 
                with a rate of interest lower than the market rate.
