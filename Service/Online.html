            <h1>History of Online</h1>
            <p>Online information systems and services often develop from a conglomerate of loosely related events. 
                Coherent historical narratives documenting their development can be difficult to construct because 
                of the diversity of sources as well as the fundamental problem of finding logical boundaries for 
                the research.<br/> As a result, chroniclers of online information systems tend to either take an 
                all-inclusive cursory approach (Meadow 1988), or conduct an incredibly detailed study of a 
                particular system or event that lacks appropriate context (Pizer 1994).<br/> <br/>  In A History of Online 
                Information Services, <br/> Charles Bourne and Trudi Bellardo Hahn are able to split the difference 
                and create a detailed narrative that addresses key contextual developments while effectively 
                holding the reader's interest.<br/> <br/> 
    
                By focusing on the period from 1963 to 1976, the authors capture the emotion and revolutionary 
                nature of moving from a fundamentally print information service system, to one that is chiefly 
                based on online systems without <br/> getting lost in the expanse of the entire evolution from Vannevar 
                Bush to the networked web. Service, as opposed to system, is the key word in the book's title. <br/> <br/> By 
                focusing on overall services rather than narrowing in on the systems themselves, the book 
                transcends its encyclopedic narrative and somewhat numbing detail to present a balanced focus 
                on people, events, and products.<br/>  This holistic approach enables the writers to interject compelling 
                biographical narratives of the key players who took developing online systems from experimental to 
                fundamental components of information service. <br/> <br/> The best example is chapter five, where the long and 
                winding development of DIALOG is bolstered by insights into integral service developers such as Roger 
                Summit and Van Wente. <br/> <br/> As the authors explain in summing up the story of online information services, 
                "It was not the available hardware, but the pioneers' visions of possibilities that pushed the frontier" 
                (Pizer 1994).<br/> <br/> 
                
                Bourne and Bellardo Hahn fill a significant gap in the information science and computing literature. 
                Among the many efforts to chronicle development of online information systems and services from infancy 
                to mature industry, <br/> none has addressed this historical period in such detail nor brought the intelligent 
                perspective of this work. The book holds one's interest well enough for a complete read by scholars of 
                the history of information science as well as being useful as stand-alone chapters or snippets of detail.<br/> <br/> 
                The indexing is quite helpful and facilitates the use of the book as a reference tool. A History of 
                Online Information Services is recommended for information science and computing collections as well 
                as anyone interested in the history of information retrieval.
